## Bioacoustics Stack Exchange

Stack Exchange is a publicly available crowd-sourced question and answer platform. Stack Exchange consists of many sites on different topics, including the original Stack Overflow (for programming questions), Biology, and even Bioacoustics. Here we provide you with a very brief introduction to Stack Exchange to help you use the platform effectively.

Bioacoustics Stack Exchange was built BY US, FOR US

1.  Register for [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/){target="_blank"}

2.  Join [Bioacoustics Stack Exchange](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com/){target="_blank"}, which is a site within the larger Stack Exchange enterprise
    We recommend using a helpful username, and completing as much as the profile as you feel comfortable completing. This is a community, and we hope you can feel comfortable being yourself!
    
3.  Learn how to search for questions: learn how to find information [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/searching#:~:text=Enter%20search%20terms%20in%20the,every%20page%2C%20and%20press%20Enter%20.){target="_blank"}

4.  Learn how to write a good question: Remember that these questions and answers are archived and will be useful down the road. Ask ONE question (not a series of questions), and be thoughtful about your title, providing background to your question, linking to relevant background information, and being clear about your question. More information on asking a good question can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask){target="_blank"} 
  When your question is answered (well!), please be sure to select the answer

5.  Learn how to write a good answer: Do you have an answer? Or a clarifying question or discussion point? If you do not have an explicity answer (or part of an answer), then you want to add a comment below the question (comments are not retained for eternity). If you have an answer (partial or complete), then by all means, answer it! More information on giving good answers can be found [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer). And yes, you can answer your own question! This is a helpful way to share new information you learned that you wish was easily searchable! For more information on answering your own question, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/help/self-answer#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20a%20question,on%20a%20Stack%20Exchange%20site.){target="_blank}
