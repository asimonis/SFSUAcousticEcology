An analysis methods section is required and should include the following information;

-   Data Prep and Archive
    -   Data prep (decompressing, creating LTSAs, decimating, etc.)
        -   [SAEL example](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-analysis-methods/content/DataArchive/DataPrep.html)
    -   Data quality checks (QAQC scripts)
        -   [SAEL example](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-analysis-methods/content/DataArchive/DataQualityCheck.html)
    -   Data upload steps
        -   If you have a internal storage include directions here on where data should be stored and in what format

        -   You can also include a data managment structure with standardized naming and storage/folder structures

        -   [SAEL example](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-analysis-methods/content/DataArchive/DataUpload.html)
-   Analysis methods for each species, group, or sound source
    -   You can break this down by baleen and toothed whales, soundscapes, etc.

    -   Each section should include detailed and reproducible methods that anybody can recreate

You can also link to a separate hardware repository if needed ([SAEL example](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Analysis-adrift.html))
