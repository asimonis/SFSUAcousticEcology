The SFSU Acoustic Ecology Lab conducts research using passive acoustic monitoring to information marine and estuarine conservation. We are part of the [Estuary and Ocean Science Center](https://eoscenter.sfsu.edu) at [San Francisco State University](https://www.sfsu.edu).

This lab manual serves as the go-to handbook for the behind-the-scenes information to support our science.
